# Room Service
Prototype of a delivery robot, designed for hotels or inter-building use. 

## Purpose
This project was created for ELEC 6530. It aims to provide a proof
of concept for a simple robot delivery system. It will does this
by navigating a small course to deliver items to certain rooms.

## Navigation
Room Service uses a line follower sensor for navigation in the prototype 
course. To find rooms, it has an RFID sensor that looks for RFID tags
embedded into the course. It also has sonar sensors to avoid collision.
